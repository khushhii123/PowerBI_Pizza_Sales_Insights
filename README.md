# PowerBI_Pizza_Sales_Insights
## Overview
This Pizza Sales Analysis project outlines ways to effectively analyze and visualize data using SQL and Power BI to gain valuable insights into a pizza's sales trends and product performance.The Pizza Sales Project analyzes and visualizes sales data from a fictional pizza restaurant chain. This project extracts and transforms data using SQL, and also visualizes data using Power BI. The project's purpose is to deliver insights and actionable information to help the pizza restaurant chain optimize its operations, increase sales, and improve customer satisfaction.
## Problem Satement
A popular pizza restaurant wants to improve its sales and marketing methods in order to boost revenue and improve client satisfaction. To accomplish this, the corporation must evaluate its sales data to gain insights about the customer preferences, sales patterns, and product performance. The goal is to extract insights from the data and make meaningful recommendations to help increase sales. The client structured the problem statement into two portions.
### 1.KPI 
- Total Revenue
- Total Orders
- Average Order Value
- Total Pizzas Sold
- Average Pizzas Per Order
### 2. Chart Visualization
- Daily Trend For Total Order
- Montly Trend For Total Order
- Percentage of Sales By Pizza Category Size
- Total Pizzas Sold By Pizza Category
- Top 5 selling and bottom 5 least selling Pizzas

  ## Objective
  Use SQL queries to conduct a detailed sales performance study for a pizza store, and then use Power BI to show the results. The goal is to gather insights on sales trends, revenue distribution, and top-performing items in order to make strategic decisions and optimize sales methods.

## Project Component
### 1.Data Acquisition
The process begins with the collection of raw sales information. This information may include client orders, product specifications, order dates, and transaction amounts. Data may be retrieved from a variety of sources, including databases, CSV files, and other data storage systems.
### 2. Data Transformation
The raw data is cleaned, filtered, and formatted for analysis using SQL (Structured Query Language). This could entail operations like data aggregation, table joining, addressing missing values, and developing new computed fields.
### 3. Data Analysis
Once the data is prepared, various SQL queries are written to perform in-depth data analysis. This may include:
- Percentage of Sales By Pizza Category Size
- Identifying top-selling pizza flavors.
- Analyzing sales trends over time.
- Evaluating customer demographics and preferences.
- Calculating average order values.
- Assessing the performance of individual restaurant locations.
### 4. Power BI Visualization
Interactive visualizations that highlight the conclusions drawn from the data analysis are made with Power BI. The following might be included in the visualizations:
- Sales by product category are shown using pie charts and bar charts.
- Sales patterns are depicted using time series charts.
- key performance indicator (KPI) summary dashboards.
